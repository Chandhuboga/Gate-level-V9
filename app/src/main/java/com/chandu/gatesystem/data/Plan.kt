/**
 * General Aptitude combines 4 chapters — Verbal, Quantitative, Analytical & Logical
 * Reasoning, and Spatial Aptitude — every single day. Instead of a flat 40-question
 * label, the full GA syllabus is split into 3 balanced slots (slot 1/2/3) and those
 * 3 slots repeat on a 3-day cycle for the whole 150-day plan: Day 1, 4, 7, 10… all
 * get slot 1; Day 2, 5, 8, 11… get slot 2; Day 3, 6, 9, 12… get slot 3. That
 * repeating 3-day block is the "147 rule" applied to GA — the same slot resurfaces
 * every 3rd day (1st, 4th, 7th…) so every chapter gets revisited on a short cycle
 * across all 150 days instead of being studied once and forgotten.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: GA is its OWN single objective (see gaQuestions below). The
 * "secondary" slot in DailyQuest is a completely separate thing — Core Recall of
 * DSA / Digital Logic / DBMS / COA / Operating Systems (see coreRecallFor) — so GA
 * never appears twice in the same day the way it did in older versions of this plan.
